# STL files

- All printed parts are already in the correct printing orientation.
- Needed printing support is built in.
- Cosmetics and their corresponding parts need to be printed together; just align them and decide if and how you want to color them.
- LED_Diffuser, it is recommended to print it in either white or clear filament. Of course, you can also leave out the logo LED and print it in any color you want.

# Assembly manual

- First, install the heat inserts. Two in the bottem back, two on the top of the cowl, and two at the tp of either the StealthChanger backplate, or the MGN12H carriage.

- Next, place the 2510 fan from behind, and slide it up and "wedge" in place, those two little nubs should sit in the bottom holes of the fan further secruing it in place. Just like the Dragonburner
- Now put the LED_diffuser in the voron logo cutout.

- Now onto soldering the LEDs, you need 6x 20mm long and 3x 17mm long pieses. 
- solder the first 3 short pieses onto the out side of the first LED,
- then solder on the second LED but facing the opposit way then the first.
- now solder on the last 3 pieses second LED but make them face the say way as the other short cables.
- next, solder on the last LED, and again turn it around, make it face the same way then the first, and opposite to the second.
- lastly, solder the 17mm long cable onto the IN, facing the same direction then the short wires of the first LED and crimp on the connector.

- take the LED_carrier, and insert the second LED First, then the second and first. Its easier that way.
- than, insert the LED carrier from the back, place the bottom edge into the cowl ledge and tilt and firmly press it into place. make sure the Diffuser gets pushed into the front grove of the LED carrier.

- Now to the 4010 fans. Take of the front cover and glue in the A4Ts Backflow Inhibitor, optional but recommendet
- The slide them into the side of the cowl, like the Dragonburner.

- Now screw in the Hotend, in this example the Dropeffect NextG Fiber UHF, make sure its rotatet correctly so the cables point into the back corner.
- Route the thermistorwire with the wirehose to the opposite side because it wont fit though the cowls and backplates cable cutouts. The heaterwire goes on the other side, bend them so they go nicly through the cutouts.

- Next, place the backplate, wiggle the cables into place and make sure the metal hose sits inside the backplate grove on the bottom of the center hole and screw it down.
- Then either screw in the M3x40 SHCS front scews, with the little 3mm spacer, or M3x35mm SHCS screws without the spacer and put a 6x3mm maget on top.
- route the cables inside the cablegroves and ziptie them down.
- if using StealthChanger_Backplate, screw on the optotap pcb.

- Lastly, place a 22mm long ptfe tube and install your Extruder, in my case the Galileo 2 WristWatch and mount the toolhead pcb.
- In my case I have to use my EBB36_G2WW Mount, otherwise, the OptoTap gets in the way.

- And You are done with the Toolhead.
