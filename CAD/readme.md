- The component "Cowl_Raw" is the cowl without any hotend or extruder mounting holes, useful for copying and creating additional cowls.  
- Keep in mind that the fan duct must blow air to the correct area: the tip of the hotend nozzle should sit 1 mm beneath the lowest part of the cowl.
- v1 is the old / first uploaded version.
- v2 is the new and current version, featuring optimized ducts for improved part-cooling performance.
**Note**: v1 and v2 are not fully compatible, due to changes in the duct geometry and screw-hole locations, the dock, its cosmetic, the backplate, and the carriages all had to be adjusted accordingly.
