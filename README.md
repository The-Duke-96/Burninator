# Burninator 💪🐉🔥
This toolhead is yet another 4010 toolhead, heavily inspired by the [Dragonburner](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Dragon_Burner) and the [A4T](https://github.com/Armchair-Heavy-Industries/A4T/tree/main), all props to them.  
Thanks to Reddit user pd1zzle for suggesting the toolhead name, I really took a liking to it.

## But why?  
I created this toolhead because I wasn’t quite happy with the current toolhead options for my Stealthchanger.
Therefore, I decided to create my own toolhead to suit my use case and my printer.
I took features from the Dragonburner and the A4T and put them together, resulting in the Burninator.

## What its features?
It is small, smaller than the already compact Dragonburner, yet it can hold a UHF hotend, in this case the Dropeffect Next G Fiber with the UHF adapter, without missing out on nozzle and logo LEDs.
A monolithic cowl like the A4T cuts down the number of printed parts, screws, and heat inserts, increases rigidity, and simplifies assembly and disassembly.
It also adopts the A4Ts backflow inhibitor for decent part cooling performance.
Having a wall thickness of 1.2 mm makes the cowl more robust.

## Anything else?  
Besides the toolhead, there’s also a small custom Stealthchanger dock with an inbuilt PTFE wiper and spring-steel blocker, an adapter to use along other Draftshift docks, a Stealthchanger backplate, and an MGN12H carriage with x-endstop and klicky mount, for standalone, non-toolchanger printers.

## What is planed?
Currently, the only supported hotends are the Dropeffect Next G UHF and the Phaetus Dragon UHF, with extruders supporting the Orbiter or Sherpa Mini and Micro mounting patterns.
I plan to add support for the also popular Phaetus Rapido hotend and an overhauled cowl for SF hotends, such as the Dropeffect Next G SF, Phaetus Dragon SF, as well as the E3D Revo.
Of course, other than the .step CAD files are available for you to mod it to your needs.

## How to Assemble?
