# Burninator
This toolhead is yet another 4010 toolhead, inspired by the [Dragonburner](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Dragon_Burner) and the [A4T](https://github.com/Armchair-Heavy-Industries/A4T/tree/main), all props to them.  
Thanks to reddit user pd1zzle for suggesting the toolhead name, I really took a liking to it.
