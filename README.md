# Burninator v2 💪🐉🔥
This toolhead is yet another 4010 toolhead, heavily inspired by the [Dragonburner](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Dragon_Burner) and the [A4T](https://github.com/Armchair-Heavy-Industries/A4T/tree/main), all props to them.  
Thanks to Reddit user pd1zzle for suggesting the toolhead name, I really took a liking to it.

## But why?  
I created this toolhead because I wasn’t quite happy with the current toolhead options for my Stealthchanger.
Therefore, I decided to create my own toolhead to suit my use case and my printer.
I took features from the Dragonburner and the A4T and put them together, resulting in the Burninator.

## What its features?
It is small, smaller than the already compact Dragonburner, yet it can hold a UHF hotend, in this case the Dropeffect Next G Fiber with the UHF adapter, without missing out on nozzle and logo LEDs.
A monolithic cowl like the A4T cuts down the number of printed parts, screws, and heat inserts, increases rigidity, and simplifies assembly and disassembly.
Having a wall thickness of 1.2 mm makes the cowl more robust.  
It also adopts the A4Ts backflow inhibitor for decent part cooling performance.

**Note:**  
The NextG Hotend should have the same dimensions as the Dragon and the TZ hotend.  
The NextG UHF should have the same dimensions as the Dragon UHF, Rapido HF should also fit. 

## Anything else?  
Besides the toolhead, there’s also a small custom Stealthchanger dock with an inbuilt PTFE wiper and spring-steel blocker, an adapter to use along other Draftshift docks, a Stealthchanger backplate, and an MGN12H (Voron-2) and MGN7H (Voron-0) carriage with x-endstop and klicky mount, for standalone, non-toolchanger printers.

## What is planed?
For now, not much, testing out some ideas. 
You can also do request and I can take a look at it and upload it in the future. 
Of course, .step CAD files are available for you to mod it to your needs.

## How to Assemble?
Here's a handy-dandy [Assembly manual](https://github.com/The-Duke-96/Burninator/blob/main/STL/readme.md)

## Disclaimer:
It turns out that when using printed parts for the Z-joints, the toolhead might be so small that the carriage of the Z linear rail hits the bottom of the frame before the toolhead touches the print bed for probing or leveling, since I have used a CNC kit for those parts from the beginning, I didn’t notice or consider it, a simple workaround is to add taller spacers or washers beneath the print bed, or use a diffrent, shorter Z-joints.
